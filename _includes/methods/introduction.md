This section documents the methods available from the Verovio toolkit. The methods are public methods of the C++ `vrv::Toolkit` class. They are all available in the Python and JavaScript bindings, unless specified otherwise. For examples, all the methods reading a file or writing to a file are not available in the JavaScript version of the toolkit.

The names of the methods is also indentical across the different versions of the toolkit except for the capitalisation. The original C++ method names are UpperCamelCased in C++ but lowerCamelCased in the Python and JavaScript bindings. This is only to make the bindings follow more idiomatic capitalisation.

For the methods taking parameters as stringified JSON objects (or returning one), the objects are not stringified in the JavaScript version of the toolkit. That is, a JSON object is passed or returned as is. The same applied for the Python toolkit where the object is passed or returned as a Python dictionary.
